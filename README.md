# Simple Banking System
My 10th Python project from Hyperskill.
This program simulates a bank terminal, which allows user to create an account (generate a card number according to the Luhn alghorithm and a pin code), log into it and perform some basic operations (check balance, deposit/transfer money, delete an account).

All created accounts are stored in a database in a file "card.s3db".
